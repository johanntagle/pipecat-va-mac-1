### Tarta de Queso Vasco (Spanish Basque Cheesecake)
**The Internet-Famous Burnt Cheesecake**
This isn't your typical New York cheesecake - the Basque version has conquered the world with its unique preparation.

**What Makes It Special:**
- No crust (all filling!)
- Deliberately "burnt" top (caramelized, not actually burnt)
- Jiggly, creamy center
- Served with house-made blueberry stew
- Room temperature or slightly warm

**Characteristics:**
- Texture: Creamy, almost custard-like center with firm edges
- Top: Dark caramelized surface with bitter-sweet notes
- Flavor: Rich cream cheese, not overly sweet, complex caramelization
- Origin: La Viña bar in San Sebastián, Spain

**Flavor Profile:** 
Rich, tangy from cream cheese, caramelized bitterness balanced by sweet blueberries

**Why It Looks "Burnt":**
The high-heat baking creates Maillard reactions (caramelization) on the surface, adding complex flavors that contrast beautifully with the creamy interior. This is intentional and prized!

**The Blueberry Stew:**
Slow-cooked blueberries with sugar and lemon, creating a jammy sauce that cuts through the richness.

**Serves:** 1-2 people (rich and satisfying)
**Perfect For:** Cheesecake lovers, those seeking trendy desserts with traditional roots
**Wine Pairing:** Sweet wine or Spanish coffee

**Did You Know?**
This style of cheesecake became an international sensation, with versions appearing in Tokyo, New York, and beyond. Ours stays true to the original!

### Churros Dos Salsas
**The Spanish Classic**
No Spanish dessert menu is complete without churros - and ours come with not one, but two decadent dipping sauces.

**What You Get:**
- Freshly fried churros (still warm!)
- Crispy exterior, soft fluffy interior
- Two dipping sauces:
  1. **Thick Spanish Hot Chocolate** - dark, rich, almost pudding-like
  2. **Dulce de Leche** - creamy caramel sauce
- Dusted with cinnamon sugar

**Characteristics:**
- Made to order (takes 10-12 minutes)
- Star-shaped ridges (traditional Spanish style)
- Perfectly golden, not greasy
- 6-8 churros per order

**Flavor Profile:** 
Sweet, cinnamon-spiced, with your choice of chocolate or caramel flavor in each bite

**The Spanish Way:**
Traditionally, churros are dipped in thick hot chocolate for breakfast! We serve them as dessert but maintain that authentic Spanish chocolate thickness.

**Perfect For:**
- Sharing (though it's tempting to keep them all)
- Those who love fried dough
- Ending a meal with something fun and interactive
- Kids and adults alike

**Serving Suggestion:**
Try alternating between the two sauces - chocolate on one bite, dulce de leche on the next!

**Beverage Pairing:**
- Spanish coffee or cortado
- Brandy or digestif
- The hot chocolate sauce doubles as a drink if you're brave!
