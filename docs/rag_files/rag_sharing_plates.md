## PREMIUM BEEF SELECTIONS

### Solomillo a la Parrilla (Grilled Tenderloin)
**The Tender Champion**
Premium beef tenderloin, grilled to perfection and served with accompaniments.

**Details:**
- 400-500g whole beef tenderloin
- Grilled over high heat for char
- Rested and sliced tableside
- Served with:
  - Roasted potatoes with sea salt
  - Seasonal grilled vegetables
  - Chimichurri or pepper sauce
  - Finishing salts

**Serves:** 3-4 people
**Doneness:** Medium-rare recommended (can be adjusted)
**Flavor Profile:** Beefy, charred exterior, butter-tender interior
**Texture:** The most tender cut of beef
**Wine Pairing:** Full-bodied red wine (Ribera del Duero, Rioja Reserva)
**Perfect For:** Those who want premium beef without the intense marbling of ribeye

**Why Tenderloin?**
This is the most tender muscle on the cow, prized for its buttery texture. Less marbling than ribeye, but incredibly soft.

### Cochinillo Segoviano (Roasted Suckling Pig)
**The Crown Jewel of Spanish Cuisine**
This legendary dish from Segovia represents the pinnacle of Spanish roasting tradition.

**What Makes It Special:**
- Milk-fed suckling pig (21-28 days old)
- Traditional Segovian preparation
- Slow-roasted in wood ovens until the skin is glass-crisp
- Meat so tender it's traditionally cut with a plate edge, not a knife
- Served whole or half, presented dramatically

**Serves:** 4-6 people (half pig) or 8-10 people (whole)
**Preparation Time:** Requires advance ordering (24-48 hours notice)
**Price Point:** Premium (reflects the rarity and preparation)
**Flavor Profile:** Delicate, sweet pork flavor, incredibly crispy skin
**Texture:** Skin that shatters like glass, meat that melts

**The Segovia Tradition:**
In Segovia, to prove the tenderness, the chef traditionally "cuts" the pig using only the edge of a plate, then throws the plate to the ground where it shatters - demonstrating that the plate broke but the meat didn't resist!

**Wine Pairing:** 
- Traditional: Rueda white wine (cleanses the palate)
- Alternative: Premium aged Rioja

**Perfect For:** 
- Special celebrations
- Impressing guests
- When you want THE signature Spanish experience
- Birthdays, anniversaries, corporate events

**Ordering Note:**
Due to the special preparation required, please order at least 24 hours in advance. Worth every minute of wait!

### Chuleton (USDA Prime Ribeye)
**The King of Steaks**
A massive, bone-in ribeye that commands attention when it arrives at your table.

**Specifications:**
- 1.2-1.5 kg (approximately 1000-1200g)
- Bone-in ribeye (the bone adds flavor)
- USDA Prime grade (top 2% of US beef)
- Thick cut (2+ inches)
- Dry-aged for 21-28 days (intensified flavor)
- Grilled over high heat for crust, finished gently

**Serves:** 3-4 hungry people
**Doneness:** Medium-rare strongly recommended for Prime ribeye
**Flavor Profile:** Rich, beefy, intense marbling, slightly nutty from aging
**Texture:** Marbled throughout, juicy, with a perfectly charred crust

**Served With:**
- Roasted potatoes or patatas panaderas
- Grilled vegetables
- Selection of salts (Maldon, pink Himalayan, smoked)
- Optional: Peppercorn sauce, chimichurri, or garlic butter

**Wine Pairing:** 
Bold, tannic reds that can stand up to the richness:
- Ribera del Duero Reserva
- Aged Rioja
- Premium Tempranillo

**What Makes Prime Special?**
USDA Prime has the highest marbling score, meaning fat distributed throughout the meat. This melts during cooking, creating incredible flavor and tenderness.

**What is Dry-Aging?**
We age our ribeyes in controlled conditions, which:
- Concentrates beef flavor
- Tenderizes the meat naturally
- Develops complex, nutty flavors
- Creates that signature dry-aged crust

**The Experience:**
This isn't just dinner - it's a primal, shared experience. Sliced tableside and shared among friends, this is beef at its finest.

**Chef's Recommendation:**
"Let it rest for 10 minutes after grilling. The wait is torture, but the results are worth it!"
