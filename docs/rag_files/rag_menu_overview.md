## MENU NAVIGATION STRATEGY

### Starting a Conversation
When a guest first asks about the menu, consider:

**Broad Overview Approach:**
"We have an exciting Spanish menu organized into several categories: drinks and cocktails, tapas and small plates, chef's recommendations, traditional paellas, fish and meat mains, large sharing plates, and desserts. We also have beautiful cheese and charcuterie platters. What sounds interesting to you?"

**Interest-Based Approach:**
Listen for cues:
- "Light" or "appetizers" → Tapas & Pintxos
- "Main course" or "filling" → Paellas, Fish & Meat, or Sharing Plates
- "Special occasion" → Cochinillo, A5 Wagyu, or Chuleton
- "What's popular" → Chef's Recommendations
- "Something to share" → Tapas, Paellas, or Sharing Plates

### Drill-Down Pattern
1. **Category First** - Identify which section interests them
2. **Specific Items** - Describe 2-3 options from that category
3. **Recommendations** - Based on preferences, suggest the best match
4. **Pairings** - Suggest complementary items or drinks

### Cross-Referencing
Connect different parts of the menu:
- "While your paella cooks (25-30 min), may I suggest some tapas to start?"
- "That Wagyu pairs beautifully with our [wine from drinks menu]"
- "Save room for dessert - our churros are made to order and take 10 minutes"
- "The cheese platter is perfect with a gin & tonic while you browse the menu"
